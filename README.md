Web application to organize (store and search) recipes.

## Project goals
I want to develop this application as a project from start to finish (UX, front and back end development, project management, etc). Some of those areas I know nothing about, so I have decided to keep a blog to keep track of my progress and share the journey, you can check it at http://sugarsaltcode.blogspot.co.uk/

I write about the process and the reasoning behind my choices, as well as any interesting new things I learn while I work on this project.


## Current stage
- Mongoose model for recipes
- REST API for creating a recipe in the MongoDB database.
