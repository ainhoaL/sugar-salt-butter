Web application to organize (store and search) recipes.

## Project goals
I want to develop this application as a project from start to finish (UX, front and back end development, project management, etc). Some of those areas I know nothing about, so I have decided to keep a blog to keep track of my progress and share the journey with the world, you can check it at http://sugarsaltcode.blogspot.co.uk/

I write about the process and the reasoning behind my choices, as well as any interesting new things I learn while I work on this project. Please help me take this project in the right direction!


## Current stage
Working on Wireframes & figuring out Tech stack. User scenarios done, check them out in the blog.
UX Stage - Design.

Check out my first attempt at [interactive wireframes] (http://iplotz.com/app/viewernew.php?k=4c8bcbee1260e51e0fd509c4e8da4e2f&pr=151910&pg=151910_1&a=140301)
